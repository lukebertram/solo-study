# Solo Study

#### A day of self-directed study, practice, discovery and magical wonderment, January 26th, 2018

#### By **Luke Bertram**

## Description

This repository is intended to house the results of my day of independent self-directed study during the Epicodus Javascript track. At the time of this writing, even I do not know exactly how this will be manifested.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

For greatest ease of use, simply visit [this website](http://lukebertram.github.io/solo-study) in your web browser of choice. However, if you're feeling frisky, you can also use the following steps to clone the project from [GitHub](http://github.com) and run it locally on your own computer:

 * Visit the github page for [this project](http://github.com/lukebertram/solo-study)
 * Click the "Clone or Download" button and copy the address found there. Alternatively, just copy this address to your clipboard: https://github.com/lukebertram/solo-study.git
 * Access your system's command line interface (_ie Terminal, for MacOS Users_) and navigate to your home directory by entering the following magical spells into your command line (note: do not enter the '$' character):
```
 $cd ~

 $git clone https://github.com/lukebertram/solo-study.git

 $open solo-study/index.html
```

## Process

### Prompt

>"Today your project will be your own development. Focus on the things you feel you don't know yet; and the things you don't yet feel good at. This exercise is meant to expose your blind spots, and allow you to actively work on improving any weaknesses so you can progress through the rest of the program confidently and efficiently."

### Weaknesses/Topics of Interest

|Technical | Non-technical|
|:---------|:-------------|
| Unfamiliarity with SQL databases - research and/or implement| Need polished, comprehensive resume (including work prior to Epicodus) |
| Research Tone.JS library (music synthesis in JS) | Practice succinctly answering common interview questions (both technical and non-technical) |
| Determine how to effectively implement an RPG within an AngularJS framework (for next week's project)| Try out the Pomodoro technique to help with time-management/focus |
| AWS - start a free account and try to build/host something with it| * |
| Study, start compiling into a single file several examples of the algorithms discussed in [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms).| * |
| Brush up on Rails for a bit of potential upcoming work and to help justify its inclusion on my resume | * |

### SQL Study

* Look through Java/C# Epicodus curriculum for introduction to database Topics

* Search up an online introduction to SQL and absorb its knowledge

* Write a little summary of knowledge attained right here:

>Here is what I learned about SQL today:
> * I upgraded my laptop's version of Postgres - then researched how to reinitialize the database cluster directory so I could once again run a Postgres server from the command line. I then reinitialized that directory.

> * Data is organized into `tables` which can be related to each other by `primary keys`. Each table is comprised of `rows` which represent entries in the table. Each row is comprised of `columns` or `fields`, each of which represents a property of the entry described by that row.

> * Common SQL data type keywords: `int`, `float`, `varchar` (SQL's keyword for strings of variable character length), `text` (for long blocks of text), `timestamp`, and `boolean`

> * SQL command keywords are conventionally written in all caps, and SQL statements must end with a semicolon.


### Algorithm Study

* Binary Search
* Big O Notation
* Arrays & Linked Lists
* Selection Sort

### Rails Study

Follow along with the [Rails Tutorial's](https://www.railstutorial.org/) creation of a Twitter clone (from chapter 3 onward).

* Created a new repository on [my Github](https://github.com/lukebertram/sample-app).

* Added a 'hello world' action (renders 'hello' html statement to the page) to the base application controller and set that action as the root route

* Deployed [my new application](http://luke-solo-study.herokuapp.com/) to Heroku at http://luke-solo-study.herokuapp.com/.

* Reread the first two chapters of the Rails Tutorial in order to refresh my knowledge of how Rails implements RESTful routes and MVC architecture, as well as data validations on and associations between models.
