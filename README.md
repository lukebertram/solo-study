# Solo Study

#### A day of self-directed study, practice, discovery and magical wonderment, January 26th, 2018

#### By **Luke Bertram**

## Description

This repository is intended to house the results of my day of independent self-directed study during the Epicodus Javascript track. At the time of this writing, even I do not know exactly how this will be manifested.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

For greatest ease of use, simply visit [this website](http://lukebertram.github.io/solo-study) in your web browser of choice. However, if you're feeling frisky, you can also use the following steps to clone the project from [GitHub](http://github.com) and run it locally on your own computer:

 * Visit the github page for [this project](http://github.com/lukebertram/solo-study)
 * Click the "Clone or Download" button and copy the address found there. Alternatively, just copy this address to your clipboard: https://github.com/lukebertram/solo-study.git
 * Access your system's command line interface (_ie Terminal, for MacOS Users_) and navigate to your home directory by entering the following magical spells into your command line (note: do not enter the '$' character):
```
 $cd ~

 $git clone https://github.com/lukebertram/solo-study.git

 $open solo-study/index.html
```

## Process

### Prompt

>"Today your project will be your own development. Focus on the things you feel you don't know yet; and the things you don't yet feel good at. This exercise is meant to expose your blind spots, and allow you to actively work on improving any weaknesses so you can progress through the rest of the program confidently and efficiently."

### Weaknesses/Topics of Interest

|Technical | Non-technical|
|:---------|:-------------|
| Unfamiliarity with SQL databases - research and/or implement| Need polished, comprehensive resume (including work prior to Epicodus) |
| Research Tone.JS library (music synthesis in JS) | Practice succinctly answering common interview questions (both technical and non-technical) |
| Determine how to effectively implement an RPG within an AngularJS framework (for next week's project)| Try out the Pomodoro technique to help with time-management/focus |
| AWS - start a free account and try to build/host something with it| * |
| Study, start compiling into a single file several examples of the algorithms discussed in [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms).| * |
| Brush up on Rails for a bit of potential upcoming work and to help justify its inclusion on my resume | * |

### SQL Study

* Look through Java/C# Epicodus curriculum for introduction to database Topics

* Search up an online introduction to SQL and absorb its knowledge

* Write a little summary of knowledge attained right here:

>Here is what I learned about SQL today:
> * I upgraded my laptop's version of Postgres - then researched how to reinitialize the database cluster directory so I could once again run a Postgres server from the command line. I then reinitialized that directory.
> *


### Algorithm Study

* Binary Search
* Big O Notation
* Arrays & Linked Lists
* Selection Sort

### Rails Study

Probably just pick up the [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) where I left it on my second time through a couple months ago. Link to GitHub repo for my version of the [Ruby on Rails Sample Application]()
